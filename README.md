***Your very first own library***

>   This project is about coding a C library.  
It will contain a collection of general purpose functions the different programs of your cursus will
rely upon.

> In fact, C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. Then, this project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing
and learning to use them.

##  Description                         ##
The objective of this project is to create a static library (.a file).  
It is actually just an archive of the original .o files, made with the `ar` command (a precedessor
of `tar` now just used to make libraries).

The implemetend functions are the following:

### Mandatory & bonus functions         ###
*   ft_isalnum(1) 
*   ft_isalpha(1)
*   ft_isascii(1)
*   ft_isdigit(1)
*   ft_islower(1)
*   ft_isupper(1)
*   ft_isprint(1)
*   ft_isspace(1)
*   ft_isupper(1)
*   ft_tolower(1)
*   ft_toupper(1)

*   ft_strcpy(2)
*   ft_strdup(1)
*   ft_strlen(1)

### Functions added over-time           ###
