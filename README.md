***Your very first own library***

> This project is about coding a C library.  
It will contain a collection of general purpose functions the different programs of your cursus will
rely upon.
> In fact, C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. Then, this project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing
and learning to use them.

## Description ##

The objective of this project is to create a static library (.a file).  
It is actually just an archive of the original .o files, made with the `ar` command (a precedessor
of `tar` now just used to make libraries).

The implemetend functions are the following:

## Installation ##

`$ git clone https://github.com/mariebriand/42-CC_Libft.git` </br>
`$ cd 42-CC_Libft` </br>
`$ make` </br>

You will then end up with a static library.

## Usage ##

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra [some_file].c libft.a` </br>
And so, don't forget ton include the header `libft.h` at the top of `[some_file].c`
