***Your very first own library***

>   This project is about coding a C library.  
It will contain a collection of general purpose functions the different programs of your cursus will
rely upon.

> In fact, C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing
and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be helpful since you will use
it in your next C school assignments.

##  Description                          ##
The objective of this project is to create a static library (.a file).  
It is actually just an archive of the original .o files, made with the `ar` command (a precedessor
of `tar` now just used to make libraries).

The functions to be implemetend are the following:
