**Your very first own library**

>   This project is about coding a C library.  
It will contain a collection of general purpose functions the different programs of your cursus will
rely upon.

##  Description                          ##
The objective of this project is to create a static library (.a file).  
It is actually just an archive of the original .o files, made with the `ar` command (a precedessor
of `tar` now just used to make libraries).
